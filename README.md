## Project Structure Highlights

* **`src/app/`**: Core application structure using Next.js App Router.
    * **Route Groups/Pages**: Separate directories for different sections (e.g., `/movie/[id]`, `/tv/[id]`, `/browse`, `/watchlist`, `/random`, `/about`, `/login`, `/register`). Each typically contains a `page.jsx`.
    * **`api/`**: Backend API routes.
        * `auth/`: Handles NextAuth.js setup and custom registration.
        * `watchList/`: Manages CRUD operations for user watchlists.
    * **`components/`**: Reusable React components.
        * `ui/`: Base UI primitives (e.g., `button.jsx`, `alert-dialog.jsx`).
        * Specific components like `MovieCard.jsx`, `SeriesCard.jsx`, `Header.jsx`, `TvSeasonsDisplay.jsx`, etc.
    * **`context/`**: React Context providers (e.g., `MoviesListContext.js`).
    * **`store/`**: Zustand store definitions (e.g., `watchlistStore.js`).
    * **`actions/`**: Server Actions (e.g., `tvActions.js` for fetching season details).
* **`lib/`**: Shared utility functions, TMDB API interaction logic (`tmdb.js`), and application constants (`constants.js`).
* **`prisma/`**: Database related files.
    * `schema.prisma`: Defines the database models (User, WatchlistItem).
    * `migrations/`: Contains database migration history.
* **`public/`**: Static assets like images (`tmdb_logo.svg`, `default.webp`, etc.) and `favicon.ico`.
* **Configuration Files**: `.env`, `.env.local`, `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.mjs`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `jsconfig.json`, `components.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you need to set up the following environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Prisma / Database (e.g., Neon)
DATABASE_URL="your_neon_postgresql_connection_string_with_pooler"
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="your_neon_postgresql_connection_string_with_pgbouncer_true" # Often used by Vercel Data Proxy
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="your_neon_postgresql_direct_connection_string" # Used for Prisma migrations

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_strong_random_nextauth_secret" # Recommended: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000" # For local development. Vercel sets this in production.

# Google OAuth Provider (from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_google_oauth_client_id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your_google_oauth_client_secret"

# TMDB API (Get your v3 auth key from themoviedb.org)
NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_KEY="your_tmdb_api_key_v3"

# bcrypt salt rounds (optional, defaults to 12 in the registration API if not set)
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=12

# Optional: For temporarily disabling auth on detail pages during local development (remove for production)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE_DISABLE_AUTH=false 
```

### Getting Started Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/suhaibgamal/movies-hub.git
    cd movies-hub
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # Or: yarn install / pnpm install / bun install
    ```
3. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.
    - Copy the variable names from the "Environment Variables" section above.
    - Fill in your actual credentials and API keys.
4. **Database Setup (Prisma):**
    - Ensure your PostgreSQL database (e.g., Neon) is running and your `.env.local` has the correct `DATABASE_URL` (and `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` for migrations).
    - Apply database migrations to set up the schema:
      ```bash
      npx prisma migrate dev
      ```
    - Generate Prisma Client (this also runs on postinstall but can be run manually):
      ```bash
      npx prisma generate
      ```
5. **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
6. **Open in Browser:**
    - Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts a production server (requires a prior build).
- `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
- `npm run postinstall`: Automatically runs prisma generate after dependencies are installed.

## Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on Vercel.

1. **Push to Git:** Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. **Import to Vercel:** Connect your Git repository to a new Vercel project.
3. **Configure Environment Variables:** In your Vercel project settings, add all the necessary environment variables listed above. Ensure `NEXTAUTH_URL` is set to your Vercel production domain (e.g., `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`).
4. **Build Command & Database:**
    - Vercel's build command will likely be `npm run build` (or `next build`). 
    - Your `package.json` correctly includes prisma generate in the build script.
5. **Database Migrations for Production:**
    - For applying database schema changes to your production Neon database, run:
      ```bash
      npx prisma migrate deploy
      ```
    - This can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline or run manually before deployment.
